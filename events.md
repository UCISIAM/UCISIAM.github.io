## Machine Learning Journal Club
The Journal club has been run by Kevin Bui continuously from Spring 2021. Weekly meetings are held to discuss research papers on machine learning. We hope that these meetings will keep you up to speed with the latest topics and trends in machine learning, stimulate interesting discussion, and, in the best case scenario, inspire new ideas and collaboration that would lead to potential research projects.
